## Overview

![screenshot](devchallenge001.png)

- Demo is above ^^^
- Pretty simple, I would say. IDK I did this one in like two hours. I mostly knew everything. 
- I'm not a fan of the design. Font colors and background colors should never be that similar, its an accessibility issue. The mobile design is also unique, I feel most websites would adjust their pictures to be bigger. 
- Second Inspirational Quote of the Day: "Testing leads to failure, and failure leads to understanding" - Burt Rutan
